![Joshua Haines](/assets/josh_profile.jpg){: .center-image }

My name is Joshua Haines, and I am a software engineer at Accenture. I am a programmer down to my core, and love the idea of learning some new cool code concepts. In my free time I have been working hard on my own iOS app (more details to come soon!), which I am programming in Objective-C. I also submit code to my [Github](http://github.com/personary), and I would love to hear what you have to say about it.

### My Focus for this Blog

I want this blog to be a place where I will showcase my mobile application projects. This includes my own code, new tools I may find, or awesome new ways to accomplish a coding task. I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy making it.

If you are curious about how I made this blog, here are some links:

* My domain (thoughtsofanintrovert.com) is hosted on [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com)
* I'm using the free, awesome hosting on [Github](https://pages.github.com/)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is the blogging platform (I really like it!)
* The theme is [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) (The Jekyll Butler)
* And I used the steps over at [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) (good name) to give this theme a little more power

### My Future Goals

I'm currently seeking employment opportunities in Raleigh, NC. I love that area, and the tech industry is booming there. My goal is to find a position as an iOS Engineer with a team that loves mobile development. I'm reaching out to those companies that I think fit that description, but if you want to reach out to me then I'd love to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuashaines)!

I'm currently working on [JHCollapsingNavbar](https://github.com/personary/JHCollapsingNavbar) over on my Github! It's a custom collapsing view similar to the one seen in the Facebook app. It's free to use for your project as well.

I also have a secret app that I don't want to spill the details on yet, but I will make a post on it soon.

### Some Links

If you are looking for a good place to start with mobile development, I definitely recommend:

* [Bitfountain](http://bitfountain.io) - I learned a lot taking their iOS 7 and iOS 8 development courses. They also have courses on Android, mobile design, Apple Watch, and more.
* [Ray Wenderlich](http://raywenderlich.com) - Great place to get some tips and tutorials on iOS development. It really helps to know Objective-C or Swift first before reading their articles, but they do have some beginner tutorials that are probably helpful.
* [NSHipster](http://nshipster.com) - A fun site that talks about the overlooked bits of Objective-C, Swift, and Cocoa.
