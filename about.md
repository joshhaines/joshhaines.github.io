![Joshua Haines](/assets/josh_profile.jpg){: .center-image }

My name is Joshua Haines, and I am an iOS engineer at AD60. Previously I was a senior software engineer and team lead at Accenture. I am a programmer down to my core, and love the idea of learning some new cool code concepts. I also submit code to my [GitHub](http://github.com/joshhaines), and I would love to hear what you have to say about it.

### My Focus for this Blog

I want this blog to be a place where I will showcase my mobile application projects, and best practices in mobile programming. This includes my own code, new tools I may find, or awesome new ways to accomplish a coding task. I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy making it.

If you are curious about how I made this blog, here are some links:

* My domain (thoughtsofanintrovert.com) is hosted on [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com)
* I'm using the free, awesome hosting on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is the blogging platform (I really like it!)
* The theme is [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) (The Jekyll Butler)
* And I used the steps over at [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) (good name) to give this theme a little more power

### My Future Goals

I'm happy to update this section to announce that I've recently started working at AD60 (started in July 2015) in Chapel Hill, NC. It was my goal to find a job as an iOS engineer in the Raleigh triangle area. I love this area, and now I have an awesome job as well. If you'd like to connect, please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuashaines)!

My future goals at this point include learning a lot more about Swift, and continuing to build my knowledge on Objective-C. Not only do I want to improve my knowledge on the syntax, but I also want to improve my ability to write great code beyond syntax alone. Syntax is only a small part of quality code. I intend to use this blog as a place to share best practices as I find them.

### Some Links

If you are looking for a good place to start with mobile development, I definitely recommend:

* [Bitfountain](http://bitfountain.io) - I learned a lot taking their iOS 7 and iOS 8 development courses. They also have courses on Android, mobile design, Apple Watch, and more.
* [Ray Wenderlich](http://raywenderlich.com) - Great place to get some tips and tutorials on iOS development. It really helps to know Objective-C or Swift first before reading their articles, but they do have some beginner tutorials that are probably helpful.
* [NSHipster](http://nshipster.com) - A fun site that talks about the overlooked bits of Objective-C, Swift, and Cocoa. I'm definitely finding this site extremely useful as I gain more of an advanced understanding in iOS development.
