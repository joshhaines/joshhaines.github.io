<p>My name is Joshua Haines, and I am a Mobile Engineer at AD60. Previously I was a senior software engineer and team lead at Accenture. I am a programmer down to my core, and love the idea of learning some new cool code concepts. I also submit code to my <a href="http://github.com/joshhaines">GitHub</a>, and I would love to hear what you have to say about it.</p>

<h3 id="my-focus-for-this-blog">My Focus for this Blog</h3>

<p>I want this blog to be a place where I will showcase my mobile application projects, and best practices in mobile programming. This includes my own code, new tools I may find, or awesome new ways to accomplish a coding task. I hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy making it.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you are curious about how I made this blog, here are some links:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My domain (thoughtsofanintrovert.com) is hosted on <a href="http://dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a></li>
  <li>I’m using the free, awesome hosting on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is the blogging platform (I really like it!)</li>
  <li>The theme is <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">Poole</a> (The Jekyll Butler)</li>
  <li>And I used the steps over at <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">Joshua Lande</a> (good name) to give this theme a little more power</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-future-goals">My Future Goals</h3>

<p>I’m happy to update this section to announce that I’ve recently started working at AD60 (started in July 2015) in Chapel Hill, NC. It was my goal to find a job as an Mobile Engineer in the Raleigh triangle area. I love this area, and now I have an awesome job as well. If you’d like to connect, please reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuashaines">LinkedIn</a>!</p>

<p>My future goals at this point include learning a lot more about Swift, and continuing to build my knowledge on Objective-C. Not only do I want to improve my knowledge on the syntax, but I also want to improve my ability to write great code beyond syntax alone. Syntax is only a small part of quality code. I intend to use this blog as a place to share best practices as I find them.</p>

<h3 id="some-links">Some Links</h3>

<p>If you are looking for a good place to start with mobile development, I definitely recommend:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bitfountain.io">Bitfountain</a> - I learned a lot taking their iOS 7 and iOS 8 development courses. They also have courses on Android, mobile design, Apple Watch, and more.</li>
  <li><a href="http://raywenderlich.com">Ray Wenderlich</a> - Great place to get some tips and tutorials on iOS development. It really helps to know Objective-C or Swift first before reading their articles, but they do have some beginner tutorials that are probably helpful.</li>
  <li><a href="http://nshipster.com">NSHipster</a> - A fun site that talks about the overlooked bits of Objective-C, Swift, and Cocoa. I’m definitely finding this site extremely useful as I gain more of an advanced understanding in iOS development.</li>
</ul>
